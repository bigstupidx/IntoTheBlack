        <Dialog id="3" pilot="2">
            <Talk>Ahh, you were talking about the reconstructing project of the earth. Isn't it time for the living creatures on the space probe shoot out the DNA? We should pray for the last wise decision of the mankind. </Talk>

            <Talk>Is our choice absolutely right? Three of us won't have chance to see the world on the new planet. I still don't understand why I took the people on the space probe. They were unnecessary anyway.</Talk>

        <Dialog id="16" pilot="4">
            <Talk>That is for me to learn the last minute of human being. To write down the end of mankind. It's all messed up ups and downs. There should be one person who smells like honey.</Talk>

            <Talk>Because of the low possibility, there is a project that separately saves DNA of the earth. They are called as hotels and sperm bank. The possibility is really low. Even if someone revisits the earth, he won't find anything on the cold dead earth.</Talk>

        <Dialog id="26" pilot="4">

        </Dialog>
        <Dialog id="31" pilot="4">
            <Talk>When comparing a single cell evolved to a dinosaur, the evolution of human is nothing. Moreover, mankind itself hasn't evolved that much. Both physically and mentally.</Talk>
